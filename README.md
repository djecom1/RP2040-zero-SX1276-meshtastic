# RP2040-zero-meshtastic
This repo contains the hardware and software development of a fixed node based on RP2040-Zero and SX127X (SX1276 and so) LoRa modules.

# Hardware
## Parts needed:
- RP2040-Zero
- SX1276 Module
- Ipex connector
- This beautifull pcb (or some protoboard for ultra-DIY)
 
You can see the schematic here.



# Firmware
The firmware is not the prebuilt for the pico because the LoRa module is different. Only is needed to change the **variant** file to this.  
Then compile meshtastic with: this.
